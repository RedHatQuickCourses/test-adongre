#  Configuring Address Settings

Configuring address settings in AMQ Broker on OpenShift can be achieved through two methods: using the `brokerProperties` attribute in the ActiveMQArtemis CR instance or using the ActiveMQArtemisAddress CR instance with the `addressSettings` section. Both methods allow you to specify address criteria and corresponding settings. For instance, you can configure a dead letter address and queue for specific address patterns to handle undeliverable messages. When using `brokerProperties`, enclose the value of the `match` property in single quotation marks. In the `addressSettings` section of the ActiveMQArtemis CR, add the `applyRule` property to specify how the Operator applies the configuration. Examples include `merge_all` and `merge_replace`. Remember not to include properties specified in the default configuration, even if not explicitly mentioned in the CR. Avoid overlapping properties with the same value in both CR and default Entry Sub-entry to prevent unintended configuration overrides.
