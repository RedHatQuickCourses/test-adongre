#  Address Settings Configuration

Address Settings Configuration in AMQ Broker on OpenShift involves specifying address settings for groups of addresses using either the `brokerProperties` attribute in the ActiveMQArtemis CR instance or the `ActiveMQArtemisAddress` CR instance. The `match` property, enclosed in single quotes, defines the address criteria for which the settings apply. The `applyRule` property specifies how the Operator applies the configuration, with options like `merge_all` and `merge_replace`. When using `merge_all`, any property values specified in the default configuration are replaced with those in the CR, while unique values are kept. With `merge_replace`, settings from the CR overwrite those in the default configuration for matching addresses, and unique settings are included in the final, merged configuration. It's crucial to avoid including properties specified in the default configuration if not explicitly mentioned in the CR.
