== match Property

The `match` property is a crucial component in configuring address settings for AMQ Broker on OpenShift. It allows you to specify a pattern that matches addresses to which the configuration applies. This property is used within both the `brokerProperties` attribute in the ActiveMQArtemis CR instance and the `addressSettings` section of the ActiveMQArtemis CR instance.

### Syntax

When using the `match` property, the value must be enclosed in single quotation marks. For example:

```
'myOtherAddresses#'
```

### Usage

The `match` property uses a string that matches address settings to addresses configured on the broker. You can specify an exact address name or use a wildcard expression to match the address settings to a set of addresses.

#### Wildcard Expressions

If you use a wildcard expression as a value for the `match` property, you must enclose the value in single quotation marks. The asterisk character (*) can be used anywhere within the address string and matches any word.

Here are some examples:

- `usa-news.*` matches addresses like `usa-news.domestic` and `usa-news.intl`, but not `usa-news.domestic.politics`.
- `europe-news.#` matches addresses that start with `europe-news`, such as `europe-news`, `europe-news.politics`, and `europe-news.politics.fr`.

#### Reserved Characters

In `brokerProperties` entries, a period (.) is a reserved character. If you want to create an address pattern that contains a period, you must enclose the address in quotation marks. For example:

```
"usa-news.*"
```

### Hands-on Activity

1. Open your OpenShift environment and navigate to the AMQ Broker configuration.
2. Locate the `brokerProperties` attribute or `addressSettings` section, depending on your configuration method.
3. Add a new entry for address settings and include the `match` property.
4. Specify a pattern using a wildcard expression, ensuring it is enclosed in single quotation marks.
5. Save the configuration and verify that no errors were detected in the `status` section of the ActiveMQArtemis CR.
